# interval <sub><small>(v. $PACKAGE.version$)</small></sub>

A really simple tool meant to replace `setInterval`.  
It provides a stable interval execution and introduces some additional functionalities.

install
``` shell
> yarn add @fedeghe/interval 
```
import and use basically as `setInterval` 
``` js
const interval = require('@fedeghe/interval')

interval(
    ({ cycle, at }) => console.log(`cycle #${cycle} ${at}`),
    100
).run()
```
but we can for example plan the end and hook a function there:
``` js
interval(
    ({ cycle, at }) => console.log(`cycle #${cycle}: (${at})`),
    100
)
.endsIn(1e3)
.onEnd(({ at }) => console.log(`ENDED at ${at}`))
.run(({ at }) => console.log(`STARTED at ${at}`));

```

getting

```
STARTED at 1679946525631
cycle #0: 1679946525738 // distance from target : 7
cycle #1: 1679946525831 // " 0
cycle #2: 1679946525932 // " 1
cycle #3: 1679946526031 // " 0
cycle #4: 1679946526132 // " 0
cycle #5: 1679946526232 // " 0
cycle #6: 1679946526332 // " 0
cycle #7: 1679946526431 // " 1
cycle #8: 1679946526532 // " 0
cycle #9: 1679946526633 // " 1
ENDED at 1679946526637   // end 6
```
as You can see the distance between each contiguous tick is quite good, but more importantly ont the long run it does nto diverge.

**IMPORTANT**: when using `endsIn` to set the interval horizont be sure to invoke `run` **after** and  not **before** `endsIn`

more examples:

<summary>here is a less trivial example using almost all available methods</summary>

``` js

and the output is similar to

### _API_
**`interval(ticking Æ’n, tick)`**  
requires a _ticking_ function and _ms_ integer to know the execution period: Æ’n will be invoked every _ms_ milliseconds;  
 returns an _interval_ instance where the following methods are available:

- **`run(Æ’n)`** to start it, optionally accepts a function that will be called once started passing to it _**some info**_
- **`endsIn(ms)`** to plan a stop after _ms_ milliseconds
- **`end()` meant to be called in `.at`** to force a stop  
- **`pause(_slide_)` meant to be called in `.at`**  
    - invoke it with no parameter to just pause the ticking notifications  
    - pass `true` when invoking it to pause the notifications and to move forward the planned end accordingly; in case the interval does not have a planned end then the _slide_ parameter will have no effect. 
- **`resume()` meant to be called in `.at`** to resume it manually from a pause  
- **`tune(ms)` meant to be called in `.at`, require `endsIn`**  
    live add or remove `ms` milliseconds to the event horizont depending on the sign; clearly enough if one removed more than the remainder the interval will stop immediately; in case the interval does not have a planned end then the `tune` has no effect.     
- **`at(ms, Æ’n)`** after `ms` milliseconds execute `Æ’n` passing _**some info**_     
- **`getStatus()`** get _**some info**_    

then few hooks are available to observe relevant events:
- **`onErr(Æ’n)`** to pass a function that will handle any thrown err; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving `{error, i}` (where `i` is the interval instance)
- **`onEnd(Æ’n)`** to pass a function that will be called when `end` will be called; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving _**some info**_  
- **`onStart(Æ’n, _first_)`** to pass a function that will be called when `run` will be called; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving _**some info**_; optionally one can pass `true` as second parameter so this will become the first function invoked at _start_.
- **`onPause(Æ’n)`** to pass a function that will be called when `pause` is called; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving _**some info**_ 
- **`onResume(Æ’n)`** to pass a function that will be called when `resume` is called; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving _**some info**_  
- **`onTune(Æ’n)`** to pass a function that will be called when `tune` is called; _Æ’n_ will be invoked receiving _**some info**_ with additionally `ms` 

_**some info**_ consists in a object containing: 
- **`at`**: the epoch of the event 
- **`cycle`**: an integer containing the currect cycle of notification 
- **`elapsed`**: the elapsed time (pauses included)   
- **`effective`**: the elapsed time (pauses excluded)
- **`remaining`**: the remaining time
- **`progress`**: the progress percentage (float, precision 3)
- **`status`**: the status of the instance among `['init', 'running', 'paused', 'ended', 'error']`

## Sliding pauses  
Sliding pauses make sense **only in case** the end of the interval is defined, thus only when `endsIn` is invoked.

![100runs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedeghe/interval/master/schema-slide.jpeg)  

here the end is set calling `endsIn`, then we trigger two different pauses:  
- **a sliding pause**:  
     pauses the ticking notifications until resumed, assuming the pause lasts for `TP1` ms the planned end will be slided forward accounting it.
- **a default pause**: it just pauses the ticking notifications without updating the planned end.

## Why? ... just cause `setInterval` is badly divergent!  
I tried some environments and looks like all shows time warping (+) to some extent.  

Just to summarize a bit, a metric of how bad the `setInterval` behave could be the first iteration that overlaps. 
Using an interval of 100ms for example the incident occurs already at the **30th** cycle:  
![100runs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedeghe/interval/master/compare/100.png)  
you can try it by yoursef in your node environment simply running:  

```
> yarn compare 200
// for example, or passing any integer interval in ms
// you have to stop it manually (ï£¿+c) or wait one hour ðŸ¤£
```
